13,CMS,False,1,,,"Spectrum Health Lakeland respectfully submits these comments in response to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Advanced Notice of Proposed Rule Making published in the Federal Register on October 30, 2018, regarding the International Pricing Index (IPI) Model for Medicare Part B drugs.  Spectrum Health Lakeland serves the Southwest Lower Michigan area as a Disproportionate Share Hospital under the 340B Program.  Spectrum Health Lakeland serves many low-income patients in the Southwest Lower Michigan area as evidenced by our CMS Disproportionate Share Percentage of 20.17%.  The 340B program is intended to provide resources to hospitals serving high volumes of low-income patients to enable those hospitals to provide more comprehensive services and treat more patients.

Spectrum Health Lakeland supports CMS for its efforts to reduce drug prices.  We are concerned, however, that the IPI Model would unintentionally eliminate the 340B program, which would negatively impact the ability of safety-net providers to treat low-income and vulnerable patients.  We also have several operational and patient care concerns relating to the IPI Model.  We ask that CMS consider measures to preserve the 340B program and address the patient care and operational issues in the attached file.

46,CMS,False,1,,,"APhA is pleased to submit comments to CMSs advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) to solicit public comments on potential options for testing changes to payment for certain separately payable Part B drugs and biologicals. APhA, founded in 1852 as the American Pharmaceutical Association, represents 62,000 pharmacists, pharmaceutical scientists, student pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and others interested in improving medication use and advancing patient care. APhA members provide care in all practice settings, including community pharmacies, hospitals, long-term care facilities, community health centers, physician offices, ambulatory clinics, managed care organizations, hospice settings, and the uniformed services. 

APhA strongly supports patient access to affordable and cost-effective medications and appreciates HHSs continued efforts to look at ways to improve efficiencies and reduce patients rising prescription drug costs by reforming current Medicare reimbursement models. As CMS notes in the ANPRM, many Part B medications are expensive, making it difficult for providers, including pharmacies, particularly those which are small, to float the inventory expense of these products for an extended period. In addition, it is administratively burdensome for pharmacists and pharmacies to obtain reimbursement for the Part B drugs they are able to provide, and reimbursements often fail to cover the actual cost of the product. As a result, patient access to many of these needed Part B medications is hindered because pharmacies cannot provide many of these products due to inadequate reimbursement and often undergo a complicated and time-consuming audit process requiring dozens of pages of documentation. APhA appreciates CMS testing any new model before implementing this policy more broadly but has some concerns with the proposed IPI model and offers the following comments. (See, attached .PDF for full comments). 

We appreciate CMSs continued work to spend health care dollars more cost-effectively for the benefit of the Medicare Program and its beneficiaries. As CMS moves forward, we hope you will use APhA as a resource. Thank you again for the opportunity to provide information on this important issue. If you have any questions or require additional information, please contact Michael Baxter, Director of Regulatory Affairs, at mbaxter@aphanet.org or by phone at (202) 429-7538.

84,CMS,False,0,,,"CMS is still moving in a wrong headed direction in pricing prescriptions in my opinion.  The vast majority of drugs covered under Medicare Part B could and should be covered under the Medicare prescription drug program, Medicare Part D.  The current procedure causes many problems for patients and providers, primarily pharmacies.  In some cases there is a disconnect so patients may not receive needed medications since it is not completely clear as to where the drug should be billed.  Pharmacies cannot continue to guess whether Part B or Part D is the appropriate billing mechanism.  In some cases a patient could be Part D eligible and also on dialysis, plus possibly in a rehab bed in a nursing home creating a billing dilemma.  Add hospice to the list and there can be other problems also.  

CMS has also created NADAC, National Average Drug Acquisition Cost, database.  This is a very good data base that pays pharmacies appropriately.  This should be used for virtually all drug pricing, including Part D prescriptions, hospice, dialysis, rehab patients, and any other Federal Government prescription drug pricing program.  With this pharmacies need to be compensated at a level that covers their cost to dispense based on state averages.  Each state Medicaid program had to conduct a survey recently or use an average of the surrounding states.  Also the National Community Pharmacist Association and National Association of Chain Drug Stores has conducted 2 surveys in the last 10 years and correlate very well with the state values.  

Do not re-invent the wheel and spend time trying to figure out something new when a method is already available.

258,CMS,False,0,,,"This proposed legislation would require pharmaceutical companies to sell their medicines in the United States for no more than the median price charged in five countries  Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan. If companies refuse to cut prices in the United States, the federal government could revoke existing patents or market exclusivities and allow generic drug manufacturers to sell knockoff copies of the medicines.

Such bills are deeply misguided. They'd stifle medical research, cutting Americans off from potentially life-saving new therapies.
Bringing a new drug to market is a monumental endeavor. It takes $2.6 billion and more than 10 years to do so, according to a study from the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development.

Researchers need to recoup this investment when the drug goes to market. If they can't price medications accordingly, then innovation isn't financially feasible. That would deprive patients of crucial new cures.

Plenty of research confirms this. One analysis of 25 major markets worldwide revealed that countries that had lower projected prices or smaller markets for new drugs launched fewer new drugs. It also took a longer time to launch those drugs. Another comprehensive study conducted at the University of Pennsylvania found that price controls would cause research and development intensity to decline between 36 and 48 percent.

Currently, the U.S. is a leader in medical innovation. We fund nearly half of the entire world's medical research and development, according to The Council of Economic Advisers. And from 2000 to 2010 (among the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and the U.K.) the U.S. companies produced 57 percent of new chemical entities, according to a report from the Milken Institute.

If the United States imposes drug price controls, medical innovation will grind to a halt, and ultimately hurt patients. This must not be allowed happen.

European-style socialist drug price controls on American companies, will bring medical development will come to a halt, cutting off our access to potentially life-saving medicines.

This is due to the rebates and discounts we receive. This revenue is needed to pay for the high administrative costs of running our practice, which includes obtaining prior authorizations for buy and bill and specialty pharmacy drugs, and  initiating and maintaining patients on free drug programs. This is very important in order to keep patients compliant with our treatment pathways, which are designed to increase the value of care we deliver.  We would be forced to reduce our staff #s significantly if buy and bill revenue is limited to 6% of ASP, and even more so if ASP were reduced by 30%. As a consequence, our ability to deliver high value care would be compromised. 


The reduction of income for rheumatologists in general would likely worsen the already existing shortage of rheumatologists practicing in the United States. This is because rheumatologists are one of the lowest paid specialists. 

Given that the group I belong to has multiple practices utilizing buy and bill drugs over a widespread geographic area, if part of our practice is included in the trial period, that would be a huge disruption to our business.

459,CMS,False,0,,,"Dear Sir/Madam,

I have been a private practice retina specialist for ten years and have witnessed in horror the high drug prices we pay in the United States versus the other countries. This includes everything from injectables to eye drops.  The high prices of the injectables in my clinic have prevented me from making it available to many patients due to the cost especially in light of uncertainty whether insurances will reimburse for these costly drugs.  Many patients, especially the poor can access these drugs more easily.  I can also afford to include these injectables for my free patients as many need them right now, if the prices are lowered. 

Yes the drug companies would argue that it will stifle innovation and lower the stock prices and what not, but why not have the Europeans, the Japanese and other wealthy nations share the cost, rather than charging Americans 5-30 times what it cost overseas.  The extent of the price differences are so dramatic, you don't see it in essentials like food, oil or car prices, and even the non-essentials.  My academic colleagues on the drug company dough will tell you that it will affect their ""research dollars"" but I believe our profession as physicians is to care for the well-being of the patients.  We also need to preserve the financial health of Medicare so it will be available for years to come.  I also believe the drug sales volume will increase partially offset the profit loss by the drug companies, in the process of helping more patients.  

If CME can require me, as a physician to charge Medicare patients less than my cash paying patients, I don't see why we can't do this for the drug companies.  Sure, I would like to charge 500 dollars a visit, and I believe I am worth it, but as a Medicare provider I have agreed to the CMS lower pricing. Physicians have endured cuts down to bare bones where many are leaving the profession and Medicare. I don't see anything wrong with doing that for a drug where the price of one injection surpasses my Medicare payment for all the other patients combined that day.  If that's the true price, then charge it equally across the globe.  If we are only the ones paying the inflated prices, this needs to stop.  Other large economies don't need us to subsidize.

Proposed Rule for Medicare International Pricing Index Model for Medicare Part B Drugs


This proposed test model adds yet another layer/middleman to the drug contracting, acquisition and delivery process already in place.  While healthcare providers are in agreement that lower drug pricing is a necessity this proposed model appears to lessen provider/physician influence over patient care and increase the complexity of an already complex system.  Very few healthcare providers are making large margins on Medicare reimbursed drug infusions.  It is preferred for CMS to negotiate directly with the pharmaceutical industry and require the industry to supply hospitals with discounted drugs for their Medicare population (somewhat like the 340b program) rather than create additional operational burdens for providers.

I fear that this proposed model will influence drug selection similar to the current Prescription Drug Benefit Managers and ultimately open sites to directly compete with healthcare providers to provide direct patient care.  I would also assume that the commercial payors will get involved to be become these private sector vendors.  This opens the door for expanding the practice of how the middlemen make their dollars through rebates and payments which will not result in the price transparency CMS is hoping to achieve. 

Requests for Feedback and Information related to Model Vendor:
The only way this proposal will work is if the relationship between the model vendors and health care providers should purely be transactional around drug purchasing and distribution.  There is mention in the proposed model about shared savings and reducing overall costs in the proposed guideline; however, the cost reduction should purely come from the changes to the drug cost via the pricing index changes.  This begs the question on why someone would want to be a model vendor (i.e. what is in it for them).  The model vendors will need to look for ways to generate revenue outside of just applying minor cost mark-ups per transaction.  This then starts looking like the Prescription Drug Benefit model which there is limited (even conflicting) data that these models produce overall value to patients and health care economics.

200,CMS,False,1,,,"ANPRM: Potential International Pricing Index Model for Medicare Part B Drugs
	The International Pricing Index (IPI) Model proposed in CMS-5528-ANPRM is predicated on the assertion that the United States (U.S.) Medicare program pays higher prices for prescription medications than economically-similar countries (Executive Summary, page 4). This assertion is based on a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) analysis of acquisition costs for 27 Medicare Part B physician-administered drugs in the U.S. compared to the cost of these drugs in 16 other developed [countries], including Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom (2. International Prices relative to U.S. Prices, pp. 14-15). This analysis found that U.S. prices for these 27 drugs were 1.8 times higher than the countries compared, with the U.S. listing the highest prices for 19 of the 27 products examined (2. International Prices relative to U.S. Prices, pp. 14-15).
	The conclusion drawn from these international data that Medicare beneficiaries and the Medicare Program are bearing unnecessary, potentially avoidable costs for Part B drugs should be re-examined in light of recent data from a six-year, 25 country study of price determination across international pharmaceutical markets for a comprehensive list products from the MIDAS IMS database shows that U.S. drug prices are not significantly higher in the U.S. than in other developed economies, especially those countries that are lightly regulated (Cabrales & Jimnez-Martn, 2013).
	The countries studied include Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, Italy, Austria, Belgium, France, Greece, Japan, Portugal, Spain, Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Holland, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, (Cabrales & Jimnez-Martn, 2013), which encompasses 10 of the economies examined in the HHS analysis. The study found that in less regulated, developed countries, there was little evidence that average prices for drugs were higher in the U.S. than in other, similar economies (Cabrales & Jimnez-Martn, 2013). In fact, evidence showed that for very common drugs, such as generic products for which there is a competitive market in the U.S., prices in the U.S. were lower than those in other developed countries where less competition in unbranded generic products exists due to universal health care systems (Cabrales & Jimnez-Martn, 2013).
	The Cabrales and Jimnez-Martn study results contradict the assertion that U.S. drug prices are higher than those in other developed countries. In other lightly regulated countries prices were shown to be higher or similar to U.S. prices, especially concerning products for which other developed nations cannot exert price controls or which are not subject to free market competition. The study also found that multinational firms in all developed countries enjoy a price advantage, and that it is only non-multinational firms in the U.S. or similar economies that offer lower prices to consumers in order to effectively compete with larger firms (Cabrales & Jimnez-Martn, 2013). 
	Thus, even in similar economies with universal health care systems drug prices are not driven primarily by regulation, consumer needs, or social welfare considerations, but by the market power of U.S. and foreign multinational corporations. Long-term incentives to innovation for and regulation of U.S. and foreign multinational corporations across developed nations may be the way to curb drug prices over time (Cabrales & Jimnez-Martn, 2013). At present, however, there is little evidence that U.S. drug prices on most products are significantly higher than those in other countries, or that price control innovation exerted only in the U.S. will make a significant difference in the prices U.S.-based multinational drug firms are able to command in this and other developed countries (Cabrales & Jimnez-Martn, 2013). Further study to ascertain socially-beneficial benchmarks for drug prices is needed and desirable (Cabrales & Jimnez-Martn, 2013), but in the meantime, attempts to bring Medicare formulary prices in line with prices for similar products in other developed economies may be based on the false premise that drug prices are higher than those in other countries, and a lack of understanding of how multinational market forces are driving drug prices higher internationally. It is therefore unlikely, in this commentators view, that CMS alone can adequately influence international drug market forces to lower drug prices for the benefit of Medicare beneficiaries and Medicare.

Re: 	CMS-5528-ANPRM
	Comments on CMS Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking International Pricing Index Model for Medicare Part B Drugs 

Dear Administrator Verma:

Avera Creighton Hospital appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (""Advanced Notice"") regarding the International Pricing Index (IPI) Model for Medicare Part B Drugs.  Avera Creighton Hospital is a critical access hospital (CAH) that participates in the 340B program by virtue of providing safety net services to individuals located in rural and remote locations in the United States. CAHs face significant financial challenges and often struggle to keep their doors open. In fact, 90 rural hospitals have closed since 2010.  

We applaud the Administration's efforts to address the issue of high drug prices. CMS appears to be focused on using the IPI Model to test changes in payment for drugs that are currently paid by Medicare Part B based on average sales price (ASP). CMS intends for the IPI Model to incentivize providers to seek out lower costs for drugs and reduce inappropriate utilization by changing the add-on payment for drugs paid based on ASP. However, CMS has solicited feedback on whether to include CAHs in the IPI Model. Medicare recognizes that CAHs are unique and pays CAHs based on costs, not ASP. As providers that are not paid based on ASP, CMS does not need to include CAHs in the model to achieve its goals. For this reason and given the unique patient populations that we treat, and the challenges rural patients could face in accessing care if our hospital were included in the model, we ask that CMS exclude CAHs from the model. 



In addition, we are concerned that including our hospital in the IPI Model could limit our patients access to Part B drugs or disrupt their treatment. For example, model vendors could restrict how hospitals order drugs by requiring hospitals to submit patient and/or prescription information prior to shipping the drugs, limiting which hospital locations are able to receive drug shipments, or limiting the amount of inventory hospitals are able to access in advance of patient treatment. Such disruptions to the distribution system could also increase white/brown bagging practices, which could lead to drug safety and efficacy issues for patients. This impact would be especially problematic for our patients who may need to travel significant distances to receive care. For example, Avera Health is a rural healthcare system that spans over a four state area.  We try to help local patients receive services and infusions closer to home at their rural hospitals when working with specialty physicians within the Avera Health system to improve patient care and minimize patient travel time and costs.   


Participating in the IPI Model would also create operational burdens that could affect our ability to treat patients. Model participants would need to track model drugs given to Part B patients, which would require the creation of a manual process or investment in software to track model drugs. These operational burdens would be especially challenging for 340B hospitals, which already operate complex management systems to manage 340B and non-340B drug inventories. Imposing additional inventory tracking requirements on 340B hospitals would strain our scarce resources and further limit our ability to treat rural patients. 

We appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on this Advanced Notice. For the reasons outlined above, we respectfully urge CMS to exclude CAHs from the IPI Model.

Sincerely,

Avera Creighton Hospital

RE: CMS-5528-ANPRM

To whom it may concern:

The Illinois Biotechnology Innovation Organization (iBIO) is writing you today to express opposition to its proposed demonstration test of attempting to align Medicare Part B drug pricing with pricing found in other countries. 

iBIO is the life sciences industry association that represents the 85,000 life sciences employees at member companies, universities, service providers and venture firms in Illinois. iBIO promotes the industrys value to the public and policymakers; connects innovators to investment and talent; stimulates collaboration and fosters the next generation of innovators and entrepreneurs to transform patient lives through groundbreaking research and works to grow the Illinois economy. 

As a state affiliate of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), we join them in requesting withdrawal of this International Pricing Index (IPI) proposal in exchange for a broader review, discussion and consideration of alternative approaches to providing patients adequate access to needed treatments. If CMS makes the significant shift from a market-based payment formula to one based on foreign prices, we are concerned this will negatively impact research and development of new drugs desperately needed in the treatment of Medicare recipients. Please refer to BIOs submitted comments for further detail regarding our position on this issue. 

iBIOs life sciences sector supports over 85,000 jobs in the state.  Our states economic output in total value of goods and services supported by the biopharmaceutical industry sector is estimated at over $50 billion dollars based on a 2017 report prepared by TECHONOMY.  The report estimates average annual compensation at just over $119,000 in this sector in Illinois. Over $805 million in National Institutes of Health investments were made in Illinois in 2017.

We are hopeful CMS will engage in a revised discussion of proposals that focus on solutions that truly assist patients with reducing their out-of-pocket costs while maintaining and improving access to a full range of needed treatment options. Moving from a market-based pricing system to a system based on foreign pricing jeopardizes patient access, investment and research in innovative treatment solutions as well as the economic growth generated by this sector in our state.  

Please withdraw this proposal in favor of a renewed dialogue among our industry and related stakeholders to consider a more viable solution. 

Respectfully submitted,

John Conrad
President & CEO

Re: 	Comments on CMS Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking International Pricing Index Model for Medicare Part B Drugs (CMS-5528-ANPRM)

Dear Administrator Verma:

Riverside Health System appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (CMS-5528-ANPRM) regarding the International Pricing Index (IPI) Model for Medicare Part B Drugs. Like CMS, our organization is also concerned with the high cost of pharmaceuticals, especially in comparison to other developed countries.  Riverside appreciates CMS intent to use competitive forces to lower drug prices in Medicare Part B via the IPI model, but is concerned with the number of outstanding questions and unintended consequences of the proposal. Section 1115A of the Social Security Act (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation) calls for testing of innovative payment and service delivery models while preserving or enhancing the quality of care furnished to patients.  We have concerns that the model, as proposed, would decrease coordination, quality and efficiency of care provided.  In addition, as proposed, the model jeopardizes the integrity of the 340B drug discount program. Our health system participates in the 340B drug pricing program, which has provided safety-net hospitals relief from high drug costs since the program's enactment in 1992.  

While we applaud the Administration's commitment to addressing the issue of high drug prices, we are concerned about the potential unintended implications to patient access, the increased burden on hospital operations, and the impact to the 340B program. Our organization has already had significant impact due to the 1/1/18 reduction in reimbursement under OPPS, impacting our ability to continue to provide comprehensive health care services to our community.  

The IPI Model has many unintended consequences that must be addressed to minimize implications to hospitals, other healthcare providers and Medicare beneficiaries
 
As outlined in the Advanced Notice, the IPI model contains many outstanding questions and unintended consequences that have the potential to drastically impact the healthcare system. In order to ensure the model does not inadvertently impact patient care or impede access to care, CMS must address these issues and areas of concern prior to proceeding with a demonstration model in Medicare Part B. These outstanding questions and unintended consequences include:  
 
Mandatory Model representing 50% of Medicare Part B utilization

Calculation of ASP
 
340B Program 
 
Provider Burden 
 
Manufacturer Incentives
 
Limited Distribution Drugs 
 
Vendor Protections 

Vendor Fees 
 
Vendor Billing 

IT Infrastructure

Implementation Timeline 

Downstream Impact, including patient care implications

Exacerbation of drug shortages due to market segmentation


Riverside Health System appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on CMS-5528ANPRM. Riverside looks forward to modifications to the proposed rule-making, with a goal of upholding the intent of Section 1115A of the Social Security Act, using competitive forces to lower drug prices in the Medicare Part B program while minimizing unintended consequences to providers and patients, and maintaining the integrity of the 340B program.  
 
 
Sincerely,

324,CMS,False,0,,,"This plan to decrease Medicare drug prices, would discourage innovation for pharmaceutical companies. For rheumatology practices, there would be increased and perhaps unsustainable burden.  By removing the buy and bill option it would negatively affect small business physician offices from providing infusion services.  The costs of infusions in a physicians office are substantially lower than those at an infusion center or hospital.  This plan would eliminate the ability of these small businesses to provide these services. It in some cases force them to reduce their workforce thus cutting jobs.  Further from a personal perspective, as the principle recruiter for my office, this plan would effectively destroy my ability to attract highly qualified Rheumatologists to the Midwest.  
This plan has unintended consequences that would negatively affect patients first and foremost but also small physician offices.  This would then put infusion services on hospitals which will gladly accept and actually lead to an increased cost onto the patients with facility fees and other unintended costs.  Further the higher costs are a trade off to our amazing ability to generate new and important medications.  The morbidity and mortality rates on cancers and inflammatory conditions such as Rheumatoid Arthritis have drastically changed in a positive direction just in the past 10 years alone.  This policy would immediately put a halt to that progress and unduly harm patients.  Around the world America is regarded as the researchers/innovators with unparalleled access to care.

I represent 35,000 retired teachers covered on a Medicare Advantage plan since 2007 and covered on a Medicare Part D EGWP inside a group purchasing alliance since 2012.  My role for 17 years now has been to contain costs without shifting costs to the retirees while keeping the Medicare coverage as valuable to the retirees as possible.  We have been staunch supporters of fair and reasonable drug prices including the use of generic and biosimilar drugs, where appropriate.  This comment is not to be construed as a stance on price controls vs. the free market as both elements already exist within Medicare plans, in that Medicare's regional fee schedules already represent price controls and Medicare Advantage or Part C of Medicare is run by private insurance companies with competition similar to that of the free market.
       Again, we are staunch supporters of fair and reasonable drug prices, and we want to be part of any potential solution instead of perpetuating unfair drug prices by continuing to pay for them.  Medicare Part B drugs are those normally administered by a physician, and the physician is reimbursed by Medicare based upon the non-negotiated Average Sales Price (ASP) + a 6% add on.  I would like to request that we be considered for participation in any future models or demonstration projects that would include testing alternative pricing models to the existing reimbursement pricing structure of ASP + 6%.  This request includes participation in any pricing models that help to fairly share the costs of necessary Research and Development (R&D) for the much needed innovator drugs that patients from all countries benefit yet only patients and health plans in the United States are charged.  My contact information is included in this response form.

377,CMS,False,0,,,"Below are questions submitted from Wolters Kluwer in response to the recently issued Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on the International Pricing Index (IPI) Model for Medicare Part B Drugs (CMS-5528-ANPRM). Thanks for the opportunity to submit our questions:
1.	What is the process to be used by CMS to collect international drug sales and pricing data? Will this process be similar to the one CMS already uses to calculate NADAC prices? 
2.	What safeguards will CMS employ to ensure that the data received from manufacturers on their international drug sales and pricing is accurate and timely?
3.	What is the rationale for collecting the drug pricing and sales data on a quarterly basis? Drug prices frequently fluctuate, and a drug may have undergone more than one price change within the proposed 3-month window. Would CMS consider collecting the information monthly to ensure greater accuracy?
4.	In the ANPRM, CMS requests feedback for ways to ensure confidentiality of manufacturer reporting of their international drug pricing data submitted to the agency. This implies that CMS does not intend to make such data publicly available. If this is the case, what is the rationale for this decision? 
5.	Does CMS intend to publicly release the IPI price that is calculated using the manufacturer submitted data? If so, what will be the manner, timing and frequency of such disclosure? If CMS does not intend to release the IPI price, what is the rationale for this decision? 

Thank you again for allowing us to pose these questions, and we look forward to CMS' response.

Although our healthcare system has many issues and market-based reforms are needed, this is a step in the wrong direction.
 
Not only would this demonstration limit what prescription drugs seniors may have access to, it would disproportionately affect patients with debilitating chronic conditions like Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, cancer and lupus, by instituting new barriers into the program. 
 
This proposal would also hurt the development of future cures. The United States leads the world in developing new drugs, thanks to our innovative economy and research environment. This proposal fundamentally undermines this system, reducing the ability for companies to research and develop the next generation of medicine.

Re: 	CMS-5528-ANPRM
	Comments on CMS Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking International Pricing Index Model for Medicare Part B Drugs 

Dear Administrator Verma:

Landmann-Jungman Memorial Hospital Avera appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (""Advanced Notice"") regarding the International Pricing Index (IPI) Model for Medicare Part B Drugs.  Landmann-Jungman Memorial Hospital Avera is a critical access hospital (CAH) that participates in the 340B program by virtue of providing safety net services to individuals located in rural and remote locations in the United States. CAHs face significant financial challenges and often struggle to keep their doors open. In fact, 90 rural hospitals have closed since 2010.  

We applaud the Administration's efforts to address the issue of high drug prices. CMS appears to be focused on using the IPI Model to test changes in payment for drugs that are currently paid by Medicare Part B based on average sales price (ASP). CMS intends for the IPI Model to incentivize providers to seek out lower costs for drugs and reduce inappropriate utilization by changing the add-on payment for drugs paid based on ASP. However, CMS has solicited feedback on whether to include CAHs in the IPI Model. Medicare recognizes that CAHs are unique and pays CAHs based on costs, not ASP. As providers that are not paid based on ASP, CMS does not need to include CAHs in the model to achieve its goals. For this reason and given the unique patient populations that we treat, and the challenges rural patients could face in accessing care if our hospital were included in the model, we ask that CMS exclude CAHs from the model. 



In addition, we are concerned that including our hospital in the IPI Model could limit our patients access to Part B drugs or disrupt their treatment. For example, model vendors could restrict how hospitals order drugs by requiring hospitals to submit patient and/or prescription information prior to shipping the drugs, limiting which hospital locations are able to receive drug shipments, or limiting the amount of inventory hospitals are able to access in advance of patient treatment. Such disruptions to the distribution system could also increase white/brown bagging practices, which could lead to drug safety and efficacy issues for patients. This impact would be especially problematic for our patients who may need to travel significant distances to receive care. For example, Avera Health is a rural healthcare system that spans over a four state area.  We try to help local patients receive services and infusions closer to home at their rural hospitals when working with specialty physicians within the Avera Health system to improve patient care and minimize patient travel time and costs.   


Participating in the IPI Model would also create operational burdens that could affect our ability to treat patients. Model participants would need to track model drugs given to Part B patients, which would require the creation of a manual process or investment in software to track model drugs. These operational burdens would be especially challenging for 340B hospitals, which already operate complex management systems to manage 340B and non-340B drug inventories. Imposing additional inventory tracking requirements on 340B hospitals would strain our scarce resources and further limit our ability to treat rural patients. 

We appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on this Advanced Notice. For the reasons outlined above, we respectfully urge CMS to exclude CAHs from the IPI Model.

Sincerely,

Landmann-Jungman Memorial Hospital Avera

322,CMS,False,0,,,"Dear Sir/Madam:

The proposed rule changes may make a very tangled system easier to navigate with flat reimbursement and little or
no utilization management or formulary restrictions. However, beware of the issues of unintended consequences. The model will 
seriously impact the margin of profit severely which helps private practices maintain their operating capability. Without some 
reasonable such margin, private practice infusions of life saving and life altering medications will have to be shunted to more 
expensive locations including hospitals. Hospitals have 340B pricing structure and inherently charge and receive larger margins
which ultimately cost the system and society severely. 

Rather than proceed in this fashion, CMS would be better served to direct the flow of infusible medications to private practices 
where the physicians have more direct oversight of the medical care of the infusions and cost the system less. CMS should 
focus on the cost to the system of the PBM model in which vast amounts of monies are siphoned away from patients, care 
providers, and medical institutions to financiers whose profit deprives those most in need of the monies to direct and receive medical care.

Other points to consider include:

o The model in the ANPRM would move 50 percent of the included Part B drugs under Medicare to an untested distribution 
model, putting patient access at risk and affect the ASP  reimbursement for the remaining 50% of providers outside of the 
model.
Model should be VOLUNTARY
o Providers should not collect the drug copay from patients
 Will cause significant administrative burden
 How will the providers pay CMS/vendors for drug copay?
o Providers should not pay the vendors for distribution services
 Providers do not pay for those services under current model
 CMS should pay the vendors for their services

329,CMS,False,1,,,"We strongly oppose the administrations Advanced Notice of Proposed Rule Making (ANPRM) to create an International Pricing Index (IPI) payment model for drugs administered under Medicare Part B.

This proposed payment model effectively imports foreign price controls into the U.S. by modifying the Part B reimbursement rate so that it is calculated based on the prices set by 14 countries.  To make matters worse, many of these fourteen countries effectively steal the intellectual property of American pharmaceutical companies. So importing their pricing systems is effectively importing their theft.  American law and public policy should not reward, encourage or involve the United States dealing in stolen goods.  Yet that is what the proposed rule would do.

Medicare Part B is currently calculated based on market prices negotiated in the United States and include the discounts negotiated between large payers like health plans and hospitals. This system as recently lead to a 0.8 percent decrease in the cost of the top 50 Part B drugs.

In stark contrast, foreign countries frequently impose arbitrary, market-distorting price controls.  In many of these nations, there is no true negotiation. Instead, governments force innovators to accept whatever price the government is willing to offer as a condition of being able to sell any medicine in the country and in some cases the governments will threaten to steal the intellectual property of the pharmaceutical company if they dont agree to strict price controls.

Imagine youre met in a dark parking lot by a masked negotiator who points a gun at you and demands that you sell him your car.  Do you think you will get a fair price if this is how the negotiations proceed?  Or are you just being robbed?  That is how some of these ""negotiations with foreign nations go. They are not true at arms length negotiations. It is a horrible idea to legitimize these tactics by basing American prices on these sorts of pricing regimes.

We have long opposed price controls. They distort the marketplace. They distort behavior, reduce incentives, and harm economic efficiency.  One of the biggest problems is that price controls will suppress and reduce innovation in new medicines. If capital doesnt flow to fund research and development of new medications, in the future, we will be limited to medicines that currently exist and further advances and innovations will dramatically slow. Slowing the development and supply of new life saving and life improving medicines will harm consumers and especially those who may suffer from life threatening illnesses in the future.

The United States has been the worlds leader in research and development because our current system rejects price controls and our system of patents encourages and incentivizes innovation. It is no surprise that the vast majority of new medicines are developed and launched in the United States. There is no good reason to endanger or threaten this innovation or this progress. One of costs of this proposal is that with fewer new medicines being developed, we will not see cost savings that are often found in new medicines and treatments. Nor will we see the improved quality of life that comes from these cures and treatments.

Suppressing innovation and harming American competitiveness is bad public policy. Yet that is precisely what this proposal will do. If we adopt this policy, there will be many Americans who will suffer and die of diseases that could have been treated and cured, but for this policy. We now see many forms of cancer that can be treated and cured. But had this policy been adopted twenty or thirty years ago, the current progress weve seen in treating cancer would not be available. So the government cannot simply look at the cost on a per pill basis. It must consider the tremendous human and economic costs that will be imposed if we stifle innovation.

We are also troubled by the use of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) which was created by Obamacare.  The CMMI bypasses important constitutional protections and requirements. CMMI was created to bypass Congress power of the purse as required in Article I of the U.S. Constitution.  Thus, even if this proposal had merit  which it does not  using the unconstitutional CMMI mechanism is the wrong way to accomplish these goals. 

Frontiers of Freedom and our millions of supporters and members requests that your department withdraw this misguided proposal. This proposal codifies foreign price controls and illegal theft of intellectual property rights. It also suppresses competition and innovation and will harm investment in medical research and leave future patients dependent on currently available medicines, but without the hope of new and innovative medicines.

345,CMS,False,0,,,"I am very excited about the potential of this regulation. As clearly stated, the United States pays quite high prices for drugs that are available internationally for less, and this issue adds to the high costs of healthcare in the United States.1 If drugs are available for less and we could save as a country, tapping into the international market could really help our cost issue over the long term while also creating relationships with partner countries. While the benefits are clear, I am concerned about some of the implementation plans. 
	The first concern is centered around idea of private vendors creating market competition by distributing drugs straight to the physicians and hospitals while also taking the responsibility of billing Medicare as well. While it is exciting that a physician or hospital will not need to maintain their inventory, I am concerned about the continued lack of price transparency as private vendors would own the process of distributing and coordinating payment of drugs. Furthermore, this relationship that these private vendors would create seem similar to a wholesaler. For a wholesaler to gain benefits, someone would have to bear the cost of their provision of distribution and coordination of payment from Medicare. To me, this seems as if the cost shifts from high drug prices to a middle party in the supply chain of drug delivery. The availability of international pricing dating is an area of concern. Without a way to monitor how these private vendors are truly impacting the costs associated with drug acquisition and delivery, I believe it would be necessary to temper excitement around the international pricing index initiative.
	Additionally, if the providers and physicians are no longer needing to stock their drugs, how will the cost of more frequent deliveries be addressed. More deliveries could result in higher costs, and potentially leave room for patient safety issues, as providers may not have enough of a drug stocked for emergencies. There is room for concern that the cost of both of these could fall on providers and hospitals. 
	Another issue would be around the revenue impact on hospitals and providers. The Common Wealth Fund states that, Medicare would replace its current administrative payment to physicians and hospitals with a flat fee.2 Furthermore, under the current payment structure, providers also are paid a percentage of the drug price under Part B.2 One can only imagine how much impact this would cause providers and hospitals as they do not have the ability to charge for drug administration. To think about how this issue compounds as one considers how many patients are receiving drugs intravenously at the hospital daily is quite concerning as well. Many hospitals are already struggling financially and this regulation may compound the issue as they do not have the opportunity to recoup some costs associated with administering high cost drugs. 
	While understanding that competition helps lowering the cost of drugs to the patient, there should be a fear around what that means for other players in the story. As mentioned earlier, I believe the relationship these private vendors have could result in lower prices, but with no system set up to provide transparency of these prices, how are other players, such as the provider or payer, able to understand if competition is actually in their favor. Furthermore, in the country now, there is no standard price set for any of these services or drugs as pricing is so market dependent. Are these measurement mechanisms going to require significant cost data from hospitals now to understand the impact transitioning to this new pricing index? In my experience as a provider based healthcare consultant, many facilities struggle with cost reporting especially centered around drugs and other pharmaceuticals so standard drug financials may not be available on a widespread national level.
	All concerns stated, I do appreciate the consideration of this new regulation, but I believe there must be a strong focus on transparency to allow for appropriate tracking of impact to provide focus on the task at hand: lowering the cost of drugs to patients while continuing to provide high level healthcare to our citizens.

Health systems would now not only have to deal with insurance company mandates such as ""white bagging"" from a particular specialty pharmacy, but also this new system for Medicare patients.  The assumption that these intermediaries would in fact save money for Medicare and beneficiaries has not been born out by the current use of PBMs.   The fixed reimbursement model could be applied without changing the distribution system, reducing the perceived incentive to prescribe more expensive drugs.  The proposal ignores the primary source of increased drug prices which is drug manufacturers.  Medicare does not have a formulary or review the cost justification of new and expensive therapies.  Comparing US prices for drugs to the prices in other countries that review new therapies and evaluate incremental clinical value vs. cost, is not a fair comparison.  The proposal also does not take into account how the savings reduced payment to 340B hospitals for outpatient drugs would compare to the new model.  CMS continues to focus its cost reduction strategies on reducing payments to caregivers and ignoring the source of increasing drug costs. There has been no corresponding reduction in regulation, billing complexity, or quality requirements. Record numbers of hospitals are closing their doors in America, especially in rural areas.  Drug companies, PBMs and even these new ""intermediaries"" cannot take care of patients.

491,CMS,False,1,,,"Dear Administrator Verma:

On behalf of the National Infusion Center Association (NICA), the hundreds of thousands of patients across the nation requiring provider-administered parenteral medications, and the infusion providers that treat them, I am pleased to submit comments in response to the Administrations advance notice of proposed rulemaking. NICA is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit patient advocacy organization formed to ensure that our nations sickest and most vulnerable patients can access in-office infusion and injectable medications.

There are many complex, multi-faceted challenges facing the sustainability of our health care system. Specialty medications, particularly biological products, are incredibly expensive and list prices for these drugs continue to increase, translating to increased out-of-pocket (OOP) costs for patients and increased cost burden on payers. 

Biological products are used to manage some of the most expensive conditions (e.g., autoimmune diseases, cancer), for which patients are subjected to extraordinary economic burden of disease and high OOP costs. Without access to these medications, the economic burden of disease increases as more health care services are consumed to manage symptoms of disease. If the list prices for biologics continue to increase, patients OOP costs will continue to rise while shifts in benefit plan design continue to produce insurance plans with reduced coverage at higher premiums. If health care and insurance coverage are unaffordable for those that need it most, eventually no one will be able to afford either.

NICA supports the administrations goals to reduce out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries, increase access, and improve adherence. However, there is great concern that increasing complexity in the Part B program by introducing more middlemen into the drug supply chain, increasing infusion providers administrative burden, and reducing providers payments may not achieve these goals. Particularly with a mandatory demonstration that would affect half of the Part B program and influence the medical benefit drug market beyond the scope of the demonstration.

NICA submits comments to bring the following concerns to the administrations attention:
	Reform measures that restrict, delay, or disrupt access to care may increase cost burden, produce sub-optimal health outcomes, and adversely impact quality of life. 
	Mandatory participation in a demonstration may jeopardize the sustainability of physician practices, adversely reshape the delivery channel, and disrupt patients access to care; 
	Shifting the Part B drug supply chain to be less patient-centric would not in the best interest of the vulnerable patient populations relying on the Part B program; and,
	There may be strategies to achieve the goals outlined in the advanced notice of proposed rulemaking that are less complex and less disruptive.

Re: 	CMS-5528-ANPRM
	Comments on CMS Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking International Pricing Index Model for Medicare Part B Drugs 

Dear Administrator Verma:

Marshall County Healthcare Center Avera appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (""Advanced Notice"") regarding the International Pricing Index (IPI) Model for Medicare Part B Drugs.  Marshall County Healthcare Center Avera is a critical access hospital (CAH) that participates in the 340B program by virtue of providing safety net services to individuals located in rural and remote locations in the United States. CAHs face significant financial challenges and often struggle to keep their doors open. In fact, 90 rural hospitals have closed since 2010.  

We applaud the Administration's efforts to address the issue of high drug prices. CMS appears to be focused on using the IPI Model to test changes in payment for drugs that are currently paid by Medicare Part B based on average sales price (ASP). CMS intends for the IPI Model to incentivize providers to seek out lower costs for drugs and reduce inappropriate utilization by changing the add-on payment for drugs paid based on ASP. However, CMS has solicited feedback on whether to include CAHs in the IPI Model. Medicare recognizes that CAHs are unique and pays CAHs based on costs, not ASP. As providers that are not paid based on ASP, CMS does not need to include CAHs in the model to achieve its goals. For this reason and given the unique patient populations that we treat, and the challenges rural patients could face in accessing care if our hospital were included in the model, we ask that CMS exclude CAHs from the model. 



In addition, we are concerned that including our hospital in the IPI Model could limit our patients access to Part B drugs or disrupt their treatment. For example, model vendors could restrict how hospitals order drugs by requiring hospitals to submit patient and/or prescription information prior to shipping the drugs, limiting which hospital locations are able to receive drug shipments, or limiting the amount of inventory hospitals are able to access in advance of patient treatment. Such disruptions to the distribution system could also increase white/brown bagging practices, which could lead to drug safety and efficacy issues for patients. This impact would be especially problematic for our patients who may need to travel significant distances to receive care. For example, Avera Health is a rural healthcare system that spans over a four state area.  We try to help local patients receive services and infusions closer to home at their rural hospitals when working with specialty physicians within the Avera Health system to improve patient care and minimize patient travel time and costs.   


Participating in the IPI Model would also create operational burdens that could affect our ability to treat patients. Model participants would need to track model drugs given to Part B patients, which would require the creation of a manual process or investment in software to track model drugs. These operational burdens would be especially challenging for 340B hospitals, which already operate complex management systems to manage 340B and non-340B drug inventories. Imposing additional inventory tracking requirements on 340B hospitals would strain our scarce resources and further limit our ability to treat rural patients. 

We appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on this Advanced Notice. For the reasons outlined above, we respectfully urge CMS to exclude CAHs from the IPI Model.

Sincerely,

Marshall County Healthcare Center Avera

200 Independence Avenue, S.W.
Washington, D.C. 20201


Dear Secretary Azar,

Texas growing economy is linked with our states robust biopharmaceutical sector, providing innovations in biomedical science, biotechnology and medical devices that help patients lead longer, healthier lives. Unfortunately, this progress is threatened by the announced Medicare Part B demonstration through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). This proposal stands to change the very foundations of Medicare Part B, limiting patient choice and perversely impacting the development of new medications.

This broad, mandatory demonstration would have a significant impact on what patients have access to in the Part B program, including inhibiting access to groundbreaking, innovative therapies even if they represent the best course of treatment for patients individual needs. While these changes are nominally an effort to reduce program costs, limiting patients access to potentially more effective treatments could result in the contrary as conditions remain inadequately managed and additional health care interventions are required.

Concerning to the Texas biopharmaceutical industry is the potentially chilling effect that this proposal may have on research and development (R&D) operations across the state. Today, biopharmaceutical innovators support a total of 228,353 jobs statewide. Each year, Texas has reaped an estimated $61.5 billion in economic output from our industry. This contribution, in addition to the nearly $3 billion in annual personal taxes from sector employees, helps fund programs across the state  supporting initiatives in education, infrastructure and public health. The proposed demonstration would dissuade investment in this industry.

The broader economic and industry consequences must be taken into account by CMS, but the worst effects will inevitably fall on Medicare Part B beneficiaries. Part B helps serve some of the most critically ill patient populations, who often live with serious conditions. R&D and the steady discovery of new treatments provides hope for these individuals. 

Patients and Texans deserve better than this proposal. Any changes to our health care system must take into account the need to provide patients, their providers and families the maximum amount of choices when it comes to their treatment decisions. This can be accomplished through reducing access barriers to new treatment, allowing doctors to prescribe the best possible care for patients without bureaucratic interference. The future of health care and our economy is on display in Texas each day. To protect and preserve these advances for future generations, the Department of Health and Human Services must withdraw this harmful demonstration before it goes into effect.

Sincerely,

Tom Kowalski
President and CEO
Texas Healthcare and Bioscience Institute

Attention: CMS-5528-ANPRM
P.O. Box 8013
Baltimore, MD 21244-8013.

Dear Secretary Azar,

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) recently announced demonstration, which fundamentally alters the Medicare Part B program, is deeply concerning to Colorados seniors. 

This widespread experiment may alter the coverage and current treatment regimens of an estimated 64 percent of Colorado Medicare beneficiaries, as well as, restrict patient access to innovative medications while fostering a hostile economic environment for providers.

A key to the Part B programs success has always been the critical relationship between patients and their health care providers. Keeping this relationship localized and personal helps ensure that treatment is tailored to the needs of the patient.

It is estimated, however, that the changes proposed by CMS would threaten 150 practices across Colorado by creating additional barriers between patients and the individualized care they have come to expect from the Part B program. To put that in context, thats nearly 84 percent of the oncology, hematology, and rheumatology practices in our state. Denial of care based on an arbitrary international pricing index, the creation of new bureaucratic middlemen, or changes to providers reimbursements are a prescription for poorer health care outcomes for seniors.

Our concerns are even more magnified when it comes to the impact this proposal would have on community clinics in the more rural parts of Colorado. Older Coloradans should not have to drive hours to see the providers they need to see to managed their health and negative changes to Part B reimbursement could threaten the survival of small, independent clinics that are already dwindling in number.

Ensuring seniors have access to the critical health care services and treatments administered under the Medicare Part B program is vital to preserving their quality of life and continued engagement in our communities. Older Coloradans already face significant obstacles receiving adequate, high-quality care due to mobility issues and fixed budgets. This widespread demonstration only serves to compound those concerns by narrowing seniors options and placing innovative, potentially life-saving treatments out-of-reach.

More broadly, the biopharmaceutical R&D sector in Colorado provides significant economic growth and opportunity for our state. Its estimated this sector supports 56,869 jobs across Colorado, both directly and indirectly, generating $13.7 billion in economic output. This demonstration may put those jobs at risk as well, creating potentially negative downstream effects for our state.

Ultimately, the Part B demonstrations widespread, mandatory experimentation in the existing care and treatments of Colorados senior populations may unintentionally exacerbate the very health concerns the program was designed to curb. Unfortunately, this proposed demonstration does not take into account patient needs, or the economic realities of providers and innovators across our state.

For the health and wellbeing of seniors, and Colorado at large, we call on the Department of Health and Human Services to formally withdraw their proposed demonstration. Preserving seniors access to the exceptional medications and therapies covered under the Part B program must remain a guiding principle for our representatives and leaders. This proposal falls short of that goal.
Sincerely,

I am opposed to the program/""experiment"" that would potentially affect half of practicing physician. I do not believe it is fair or ethical that arbitrarily, half of medicare patients would lose access to life improving medications.
Additionally much the small percentage (4.3%) above ASP that we are paid for purchasing and administering medications goes into over head costs such as nursing, IT,  procurement and storage of medications, office staff to schedule and service these patients.
If this model goes into place many physician will not find it financially feasible to continue administering these necessary medications to our patients. Myself and many doctors may have to either opt-out of Medicare in which case large numbers of patients will lose access to care and have to seek out care elsewhere. Or, many physician may be forced to turn these patients to hospitals or hospital owned infusion centers which will cost CMS exponentially more (you must realize hospitals are reimbursed on a separate schedule than outpatient practices, which is much more)
Also, our Medicare patients are on these medications because Part D does not cover these expensive meds, so they will be left without options for treatment or have to find a way to pay out of pocket for the deductables, donut hole expenses, etc.. which will overall increase the cost of care for patients many of which who do not have the means to pay for it.
I also find it disheartening that you go after the low hanging fruit which is doctors. We do not dictate the price of our medications. I know there are always exeptions, but by in large we are honest and hard working doctors who's priority is to do what is best for our patients and provide the best care we can despite the cost. The small amount you pay above ASP to administer these medications does not incentive us to use them and I believe is a small part of your total expenditure. You should focus on the price drivers who are pharma, retail pharmacies, PBM's, and specialty pharmacies. These entities are making billions of profit here, yet you are focused on the ones delivering the appropriate care. 
I can appreciate your effort in trying to lower the cost of medicines and medical care but I hope you take into consideration these concerns as well as others thoughtful opinions in these comments.

Regeneron is a leading U.S. biotechnology company that invents life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases and is committed to consistently and repeatedly bringing new medicines to patients with serious diseases. Founded and led for 30 years by physician-scientists dedicated to fostering a science-driven, patient-centered mission, Regeneron has developed a unique ability to translate science into medicine consistently which has led to seven FDA-approved treatments and 20 product candidates in clinical development across multiple therapeutic areas, all of which were homegrown in our laboratories. Our medicines and pipeline are designed to help patients with conditions such as eye disease, heart disease, allergic and inflammatory diseases, pain, cancer, infectious diseases and rare diseases.  Regeneron is accelerating and improving the traditional drug development process through its proprietary VelociSuite technologies and ambitious initiatives such as the Regeneron Genetics Center, one of the largest genetics sequencing efforts in the world.  As a testament to these capabilities, we have a robust partnership with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to develop Ebola and influenza treatments.  We are a company that has been listed for five consecutive years in Forbes Most Innovative Companies and received many other prestigious accolades.  We are passionate about our home-grown science and the patients we serve.

For nearly 30 years, Regenerons goal has been to use the power of science to bring new medicines to patients over and over again. We have fostered and maintained a long-term focus on bringing innovation to patients by investing our resources back into research and development of new technologies and therapies, and by pricing our products responsibly and ethically. In 2017, we invested approximately 35% of our revenue into research and development. 
In the Advance Notice, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) states that it intends to test a model that: (1) phases down the Medicare payment amount for selected Part B drugs and biologics to more closely align with international prices; (2) allows private-sector vendors to negotiate prices for drugs, take title to drugs, compete for physician and hospital business and offer a variety of delivery options; and (3) creates a bonus pool of funding for providers that would redistribute the previously established 6 percent add-on payment to cover  the costs of drug ordering, storage, and handling as performance incentives.

Like the Administration and others, we are committed to improving access and affordability and advancing scientific discovery and inventions to improve the lives of American patients. We agree with several goals of the IPI model as outlined in this Advance Notice.  However, we urge the Administration to consider several factors as it seeks to improve beneficiaries quality of care, lower cost-sharing, and address foreign free-riding including measures to: 
	Maintain and improve patients access to life-transforming therapies;
	Reduce the burden of changes on providers; 
	Exempt U.S. innovator companies products from the model when the innovator does not have control over ex-U.S. pricing;
	Ensure robust U.S. innovation in biologic therapies and associated economic gains; and  
	Minimize flaws that could render the IPI model unfeasible or sustainable in the long-term. 

At minimum, the proposal should ensure that the demonstration project: (1) maintains meaningful physician and patient access to the best treatment option for a patients given condition; and (2) does not penalize U.S. innovator companies which do not control ex-US prices for a particular drug.  Set forth below is a more detailed discussion of specific concerns and recommendations.  We respectfully request that CMS consider these recommendations before it adopts any changes to the current Medicare Part B coverage and payment program for prescription drugs and biologics.  

We look forward to working with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other stakeholders to identify solutions that will improve affordability, access, and ensure that U.S. innovator biotechnology companies can continue to invent new life-transforming medicines, increase the numbers of U.S.  jobs and contribute to a robust U.S. economy.",CMS-2018-0132,Indexed Price Concession Model CMS-5528-ANPRM,Rulemaking,CMS-2018-0132-1192,Posted,Public Submission,,1,False,2019-01-07 05:00:00,Not Assigned,DC,2018-10-30 04:00:00,69 days 01:00:00.000000000,69

472,CMS,False,1,,,"Celgene Corporation (Celgene) appreciates the opportunity to respond to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) International Pricing Index (IPI) Model for Medicare Part B Drugs.

Celgene is a global biopharmaceutical company specializing in the discovery, development, and delivery of therapies designed to treat cancer and inflammatory and immunological conditions.  Celgene strongly believes that medical innovation can lead to better health, longer life, reduced disability, and greater prosperity for patients and our nation.  To this end, we seek to deliver truly innovative and life-changing therapies for the patients we serve. We are currently engaged in 160 clinical trials with 42 novel medicines across 60 indications. In 2017, we reinvested 45.5% of our revenue into research and development to discover and develop the therapies of tomorrow.
 
Celgene strongly supports the Administrations efforts to ensure that all patients have affordable access to the care they need. As committed as Celgene is to discovering and developing new treatments, we are equally committed to patient support and access to those medical advances  a guiding principle for our company. We believe all who can benefit from our discoveries should have the opportunity to do so. Celgene focuses on putting patients first with programs that provide information, support and access to our innovative therapies. 

However, we are deeply concerned that the IPI model, as proposed, would reduce patient access to Part B drugs. Rather than promote market-based negotiation, a goal that we and many other stakeholders support, the proposed demonstration would import price controls from countries that restrict patient access as a cost control mechanism. Ultimately, the IPI model would restrict patient access, increase complexity in the physician-administered drug distribution system and significantly disrupt Medicare providers. 

Patients in the U.S. continue to struggle with burdensome out-of-pocket costs, including in the Part B program. We share HHSs frustration that other countries impose price controls and restrict access for patients. However, we respectfully encourage HHS to focus on policy solutions that will help American patients by leveraging market-based competition to reduce out-of-pocket costs, improve access and adherence and lower health system costs.

We strongly urge CMS to withdraw the IPI model in its entirety and continue working with a range of health system stakeholders to develop policy solutions that will enhance competition, strengthen market-based negotiations and promote patient access across insurance markets. Our detailed comments on the IPI model are included in the attached letter. In addition, we refer to the comments submitted by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and Biotechnology Innovation Organization, which contain additional supporting evidence for many of the points raised in our letter.

Re: 	Comments on CMS Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking International Pricing Index Model for Medicare Part B Drugs (CMS-5528-ANPRM)

Dear Administrator Verma:

Avera St. Marys Hospital appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (""Advanced Notice"") regarding the International Pricing Index (IPI) Model for Medicare Part B Drugs. Our hospital participates in the 340B drug pricing program, which has provided safety-net hospitals relief from high drug costs since the program's enactment in 1992. While we applaud the Administration's commitment to addressing the issue of high drug prices, we are concerned about the potential unintended implications for the 340B program, patient access to treatment, and increased burden on hospital operations. Given that the 340B program has a record of reducing drug costs over the last 26 years, we request that CMS preserve the 340B discount.

CMS Should Preserve the 340B Discount 

The 340B program requires certain manufacturers to provide discounts on drugs sold to safety net providers, including hospitals, that meet strict eligibility criteria. The discount is intended to allow those providers to stretch their resources to provide more comprehensive services to more patients. Because the proposed IPI model eliminates the ability of hospitals to buy drugs for Medicare Part B patients, manufacturers would no longer be required to reduce their prices. We question the value of removing this established and proven method of reducing drug prices charged to safety net providers and strongly recommend that it be maintained, rather than eliminated for a proposal that may not achieve the same level of savings as are achieved under the 340B program.

We urge CMS to retain the 340B discount model, since it is an established and proven method for reducing drug prices, by excluding 340B hospitals from the IPI Model. 

We also request that CMS make clear that the model vendors would not constitute group purchasing arrangements for 340B purposes. Since many 340B hospitals are prohibited from using such arrangements, failure to clarify this issue could eliminate our ability to obtain 340B discounts for drugs purchased outside the model, thereby terminating our ability to access 340B discounts for any drugs we purchase, even those outside the model and outside of Medicare.  

CMS Should Consider the Impact of the IPI Model on Patient Access and Hospital Operations

We are concerned that the IPI Model could limit our patients access to Part B drugs or disrupt their treatment. For example, model vendors could restrict how hospitals order drugs, by requiring hospitals to submit patient and/or prescription information prior to shipping the drugs, limiting which hospital locations are able to receive drug shipments, or limiting the amount of inventory hospitals are able to access in advance of patient treatment. Such disruptions to the distribution system could interfere with or delay patient access to treatment and could also increase white/brown bagging practices, which could lead to drug safety and efficacy issues for patients. This impact would be especially problematic for our hospital's patients, given that we treat high volumes of low-income patients who often do not have other options to receive care. 

The IPI Model could also create operational burdens affecting our ability to treat patients. Model participants would need to track model drugs given to Part B patients, requiring the creation of a manual process or investment in software to track model drugs. These operational burdens would be especially challenging for 340B hospitals, which already operate complex management systems to manage 340B and non-340B drug inventories. Imposing additional inventory tracking requirements on 340B hospitals would strain our scarce resources and further limit our ability to treat low-income patients. These concerns further support our request that 340B hospitals be excluded from the IPI Model.

We appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on this Advanced Notice. For the reasons outlined above, we respectfully urge CMS to preserve the 340B discount. 

Sincerely,

Avera St. Marys Hospital

This will stop the development of potentially life-saving medicines and limit patients access to medication by decreasing supplies.
 
The reason the cost of medicine is so high already in this country is because of government subsidies and involvement that permit insurance companies and drug companies to charge whatever they want and get away with it, knowing government through Medicare and Medicaid will always foot the bill. So prices are always driven higher. We need government to get out of the medical business and for competition to take place.

For rheumatology practices, there would be increased burden, payer requirements for prior authorizations, drug administration, step edits, cost-sharing and detailed documentation. It would also affect patient access to new personalized options. Around the world, America is regarded as the researchers/innovators with unparalleled access to care.

Re: 	CMS-5528-ANPRM
	Comments on CMS Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking International Pricing Index Model for Medicare Part B Drugs 

Dear Administrator Verma:

Pipestone County Medical Center appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (""Advanced Notice"") regarding the International Pricing Index (IPI) Model for Medicare Part B Drugs.  Pipestone County Medical Center is a critical access hospital (CAH) that participates in the 340B program by virtue of providing safety net services to individuals located in rural and remote locations in the United States. CAHs face significant financial challenges and often struggle to keep their doors open. In fact, 90 rural hospitals have closed since 2010.  

We applaud the Administration's efforts to address the issue of high drug prices. CMS appears to be focused on using the IPI Model to test changes in payment for drugs that are currently paid by Medicare Part B based on average sales price (ASP). CMS intends for the IPI Model to incentivize providers to seek out lower costs for drugs and reduce inappropriate utilization by changing the add-on payment for drugs paid based on ASP. However, CMS has solicited feedback on whether to include CAHs in the IPI Model. Medicare recognizes that CAHs are unique and pays CAHs based on costs, not ASP. As providers that are not paid based on ASP, CMS does not need to include CAHs in the model to achieve its goals. For this reason and given the unique patient populations that we treat, and the challenges rural patients could face in accessing care if our hospital were included in the model, we ask that CMS exclude CAHs from the model. 



In addition, we are concerned that including our hospital in the IPI Model could limit our patients access to Part B drugs or disrupt their treatment. For example, model vendors could restrict how hospitals order drugs by requiring hospitals to submit patient and/or prescription information prior to shipping the drugs, limiting which hospital locations are able to receive drug shipments, or limiting the amount of inventory hospitals are able to access in advance of patient treatment. Such disruptions to the distribution system could also increase white/brown bagging practices, which could lead to drug safety and efficacy issues for patients. This impact would be especially problematic for our patients who may need to travel significant distances to receive care. For example, Avera Health is a rural healthcare system that spans over a four state area.  We try to help local patients receive services and infusions closer to home at their rural hospitals when working with specialty physicians within the Avera Health system to improve patient care and minimize patient travel time and costs.   


Participating in the IPI Model would also create operational burdens that could affect our ability to treat patients. Model participants would need to track model drugs given to Part B patients, which would require the creation of a manual process or investment in software to track model drugs. These operational burdens would be especially challenging for 340B hospitals, which already operate complex management systems to manage 340B and non-340B drug inventories. Imposing additional inventory tracking requirements on 340B hospitals would strain our scarce resources and further limit our ability to treat rural patients. 

We appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on this Advanced Notice. For the reasons outlined above, we respectfully urge CMS to exclude CAHs from the IPI Model.

Sincerely,

Pipestone County Medical Center

117,CMS,False,0,,,"As a private practice rheumatologist, I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this ANPRM. I am excited to see CMS attempting to address drug pricing. As a physician who buys and bills infusible part B drugs for rheumatic diseases, I am sad to see the continual rise in drug prices. However, I chafe at the notion as stated in the ANPRM that I would prescribe more expensive part B drugs due to ASP+4.3 financial incentives. When a patient with severe RA needs a biologic, the cost differential between the various biologics is small enough that there is no rationale for drug cost to guide a decision (they are all about equally expensive). Right now, we have no cheaper biologic drugs, though we hope the era of biosimilars will change this. If CMS wants to impact drug costs meaningfully, accelerate the arrival of biosimilars to our market. I have switched most of my Medicare Remicade patients to the biosimilar for cost savings to the patient and the system.
In the current model, there are 2 middlemen, the drug distributor and the physician. I dont know what the distributor's margin is between their purchase and sale to me.  My margin is approximately 4.3%.  The fact that CMS model drops one middleman should alone provide cost savings. Physicians fall into 2 categories, those who are comfortable with the financial risk of obtaining title to drugs, such as myself, and those who are not. Those who are not, are likely not infusing drugs in office, and may be sending patients to hospital outpatient infusion centers, which are more expensive. Giving those providers an option to administer drugs in their office without financial risk, could be a winner for all parties. For those of us willing to take financial risk, with efficient outpatient infusion models which save CMS money by keeping patients out of hospital settings, allow us the opportunity to become vendors, as you mention as a potential option in your ANPRM.  If you allow me to become a vendor who can obtain drug from the manufacturer, while at the same time reducing the reimbursement from ASP+6 to an IPI model, the manufacturer will have to provide me the drug at a reasonable cost(which is lower than the current drug cost) or lose my business, and in so doing I will still be able to infuse with a margin covering operational costs, and at the same time the overall cost to the system will go down as the total drug cost reduces. I see this as a win win.
A more direct way to accomplish this without disrupting the system, would be to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices in part B, and then we could still obtain our drugs and treat our patients as we currently do, but the total drug cost would be less (ie, if you tell UCB the reimbursement for Cimzia is now going to be 20% less, Im pretty sure theyll sell me the drug for 20% less if they want to keep my business). I am unsure I would participate in a model with 100% pass through drug cost, as it would not cover my infusion space rent, infusion nurse, full time staff for prior auths, etc. I would send the patients to a hospital outpatient infusion, where they would spend more time, be exposed to sick patients, and the total cost to the system would likely be higher.
If CMS chooses to move forward with this model, the main thrust of my comments above is to allow options that serves both the risk averse and the risk-willing physician. Your notice implies that physicians and hospitals are risk averse to obtaining title to drugs, but this is only true for some.  Allow a neutral vendor to provide drug to those who are risk averse. Please fully develop the model you mention that allows physician to be direct vendors, without excessive red tape. If you limit the definition of vendor to a complicated algorithm or add red tape that only the current major distributors (CVS Caremark, McKesson, etc) can fulfill, many patients and providers will be left out in the cold. Specifically in response to the question in section III.a.1-2 in the ANPRM, making CMS a party to any agreement between parties in the distribution would likely add enough red tape to make it non-workable. If you allow a physician or group of physicians to become vendors, there is no logical reason to require them to serve as a national distributor( iii.a.2). Why not allow the current larger vendors to serve this role, and allow smaller physician groups or GPOs to obtain the drugs for their own practices directly from manufacturers?  In regards to billing and collections as per section iii.a.6, why would it make sense for my staff, whom I am paying, to expend resources to collect co payments on behalf of a neutral drug provider with whom I do not have a financial arrangement, and then for me to pay THEM a fee for ME doing that work for them. I would close my infusion clinic first.  This is another reason I would prefer to be the vendor in private practice rather than use a neutral vendor.

Re: 	CMS-5528-ANPRM
	Comments on CMS Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking International Pricing Index Model for Medicare Part B Drugs 

Dear Administrator Verma:

Avera St. Benedict Health Center appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (""Advanced Notice"") regarding the International Pricing Index (IPI) Model for Medicare Part B Drugs.  Avera St. Benedict Health Center is a critical access hospital (CAH) that participates in the 340B program by virtue of providing safety net services to individuals located in rural and remote locations in the United States. CAHs face significant financial challenges and often struggle to keep their doors open. In fact, 90 rural hospitals have closed since 2010.  

We applaud the Administration's efforts to address the issue of high drug prices. CMS appears to be focused on using the IPI Model to test changes in payment for drugs that are currently paid by Medicare Part B based on average sales price (ASP). CMS intends for the IPI Model to incentivize providers to seek out lower costs for drugs and reduce inappropriate utilization by changing the add-on payment for drugs paid based on ASP. However, CMS has solicited feedback on whether to include CAHs in the IPI Model. Medicare recognizes that CAHs are unique and pays CAHs based on costs, not ASP. As providers that are not paid based on ASP, CMS does not need to include CAHs in the model to achieve its goals. For this reason and given the unique patient populations that we treat, and the challenges rural patients could face in accessing care if our hospital were included in the model, we ask that CMS exclude CAHs from the model. 



In addition, we are concerned that including our hospital in the IPI Model could limit our patients access to Part B drugs or disrupt their treatment. For example, model vendors could restrict how hospitals order drugs by requiring hospitals to submit patient and/or prescription information prior to shipping the drugs, limiting which hospital locations are able to receive drug shipments, or limiting the amount of inventory hospitals are able to access in advance of patient treatment. Such disruptions to the distribution system could also increase white/brown bagging practices, which could lead to drug safety and efficacy issues for patients. This impact would be especially problematic for our patients who may need to travel significant distances to receive care. For example, Avera Health is a rural healthcare system that spans over a four state area.  We try to help local patients receive services and infusions closer to home at their rural hospitals when working with specialty physicians within the Avera Health system to improve patient care and minimize patient travel time and costs.   


Participating in the IPI Model would also create operational burdens that could affect our ability to treat patients. Model participants would need to track model drugs given to Part B patients, which would require the creation of a manual process or investment in software to track model drugs. These operational burdens would be especially challenging for 340B hospitals, which already operate complex management systems to manage 340B and non-340B drug inventories. Imposing additional inventory tracking requirements on 340B hospitals would strain our scarce resources and further limit our ability to treat rural patients. 

We appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on this Advanced Notice. For the reasons outlined above, we respectfully urge CMS to exclude CAHs from the IPI Model.

Sincerely,

Avera St. Benedict Health Center

As providers that are not paid based on ASP, CMS does not need to include CAHs in the model to achieve its goals. For this reason and given the unique patient populations that we treat, and the challenges rural patients could face in accessing care if our hospital were included in the model, we ask that CMS exclude CAHs from the model. 



In addition, we are concerned that including our hospital in the IPI Model could limit our patients access to Part B drugs or disrupt their treatment. For example, model vendors could restrict how hospitals order drugs by requiring hospitals to submit patient and/or prescription information prior to shipping the drugs, limiting which hospital locations are able to receive drug shipments, or limiting the amount of inventory hospitals are able to access in advance of patient treatment. Such disruptions to the distribution system could also increase white/brown bagging practices, which could lead to drug safety and efficacy issues for patients. This impact would be especially problematic for our patients who may need to travel significant distances to receive care. For example, Avera Health is a rural healthcare system that spans over a four state area.  We try to help local patients receive services and infusions closer to home at their rural hospitals when working with specialty physicians within the Avera Health system to improve patient care and minimize patient travel time and costs.   


Participating in the IPI Model would also create operational burdens that could affect our ability to treat patients. Model participants would need to track model drugs given to Part B patients, which would require the creation of a manual process or investment in software to track model drugs. These operational burdens would be especially challenging for 340B hospitals, which already operate complex management systems to manage 340B and non-340B drug inventories. Imposing additional inventory tracking requirements on 340B hospitals would strain our scarce resources and further limit our ability to treat rural patients. 

We appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on this Advanced Notice. For the reasons outlined above, we respectfully urge CMS to exclude CAHs from the IPI Model.

Sincerely,

Avera Tyler Hospital

165,CMS,False,0,,,"I believe this proposed change is much needed and will get us to the root/core of the problem the fastest...

Lets looks at specialty drug as an example.....Novartis and Gleevec (Imatinib).....a targeted cancer therapy for CML. Gleevec was available exclusively from Novartis for ~20 years (1995-2015)....the pill cost pennies to make...but the cost in the US for a year supply rose from ~$70K/year in the late 1990s to ~$120K/year in 2015...Novartis more than recovered R&D cost - Gleevec became their primary pharma profit engine for the last decade of that patent protection run.....helping to destroy healthcare plans.
 
In 2015, Novartis lost patent protection on Gleevec.....what happened? Generic manufacturers and Novartis lowered the cost to $90K/year - because the US healthcare system is willing to pay it....so, Novartis and the generic manufactures continue to swim in Gleevec profit (for a drug that has zero patent protection - and costs pennies to make). 

You can get the same generic Gleevec now in Canada for ~$6K/year. 

If the US continues to operate as is with Big Pharma - and more and more specialty meds are added to the system - we will have zero chance if stopping runaway healthcare costs..

Big Pharma and biotech startups have gone past the economic point of diminishing returns....they are using the money subsidized by US healthcare plans to fund more and more startups (where 80% fail) - well beyond the point of economic sustainability.

While creating advances in medical biology has indisputable merit, it has to be framed in economic reality (as does any business model).

By implementing this proposed rule, we will address this issue expeditiously at its root - and force Big Pharma to scale back R&D investments that are more in-line with the reality of supporting healthcare system funding - to create a sustainable model for the long-run.

Very much in-favor of this ruling - great work!  Thank You!

Attention:

CMS-5528-ANPRM
Soliciting public comments on utilizing international price controls in Medicare Part B.

Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW) is a private, nonpartisan, nonprofit, organization representing more than one million members and supporters nationwide.  CAGWs mission is to eliminate waste, mismanagement, and inefficiency in the federal government.  Founded in 1984 by the late industrialist J. Peter Grace and syndicated columnist Jack Anderson, CAGW was established to follow up on the work of the Presidents Private Sector Survey on Cost Control, also known as the Grace Commission.

For centuries, governments around the world have tried to control the prices of goods and services.  These efforts have disrupted the marketplace and created shortages or excesses.  The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) wrote in their February 2018 report, Reforming Biopharmaceutical Pricing at Home and Abroad, that foreign governments, which are the primary buyers in their respective pharmaceutical markets, force drug manufacturers to comply with pricing rules to gain market access.  Through this leverage, foreign governments are able to set drug prices below those that prevail in the United States and erode the returns to innovation manufacturers might otherwise see from selling in their markets.

Adopting international price controls is a deeply flawed proposal that has been pushed by many politicians in an erroneous effort to drive down drug costs.  It would run contrary to the deregulatory achievements of the Trump administration, which have saved $23 billion from 176 actions in fiscal year 2018.  Indeed, it could undermine this impressive progress by reversing the growth of government controls over industry and the economy that were rampant throughout the Obama administration.   CAGW urges the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to abandon the proposed rule and refocus on making other countries pay their fair share of U.S.-financed drug development.

Our complete comments are attached.

196,CMS,False,0,,,"Comments on the International Pricing Index Model for Medicare Part B Drugs

Submitted by Hadley Heath Manning to Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services
Director of Policy
Independent Women's Forum

Independent Womens Forum works to advance policies that arent just well-intended but actually enhance freedom, choices, and opportunities for American women, men and families. We have long argued in favor of greater freedom and less government intervention in health care, which would lead to more competition, choice, affordability and access.

The proposed International Pricing Index program is exactly the kind of well-intended policy that concerns us. While we all understand that the high cost of pharmaceutical drugs is a serious problem that needs to be addressed, this proposal comes with downsides that outweigh its benefit of lower drug costs.

Americans depend on drugs to improve, prolong and often even save lives. The type of price control proposed via the IPI would discourage the development of innovative new drugs and could create drug shortages, the kind that are commonplace in countries with socialized government-run medical systems. When needed drugs arent available in hospitals or pharmacies, price doesnt matter. 

Medicare price negotiations  no matter how they are structured  will always face an inherent problem: Medicare is a third-party payer. Taxpayers are interested in keeping costs low, but patients depend on prices being sufficient to pay for the needed research, development, testing and manufacturing to bring drugs to market. 

Its admirable that President Trump and his administration want to lower drug costs, but this proposal would do so in the worst way, imposing blunt price ceilings and ignoring the impact this might have on drug access. 

The problem of high drug costs can only be properly addressed by engaging the private sector, reducing the costs associated with developing and bringing drugs to market whenever possible, promoting market competition, and actually allowing more individual skin in the game through reasonable cost-sharing. This is the opposite approach to price controls, and the only approach that might successfully lower prices without sacrificing access.

220,CMS,False,0,,,"I, as a manager of solo medical oncologist office in Houston, has been struggle in balance with patient care and competitive environment, increasing cost of labor, regulation on USP 800 for the chemotherapy mixing room, high cost of medication.etc

The control of price on Part B medication is definitely a correct action from CMS. As a small office, we do have to struggle to ask for the out of pocket expenses from patients due to high price of medication. Patients are also struggle to pay for the unreasonable price  of medication. Also, we have to fight for the insurance companies which gave us all the unreasonable excuse to try to delay or refuse to pay for the high amount of medication claims, especially those Medicare Advantage plans. 

Its true, for a decent physician, just want to treat patients and dont even want to involve so much on the financial benefit. Thats why we do not have any share on any imaging center or specialty pharmacy like other physicians. 

On the CMS IPI proposal, we do think it is a big step to change the high price of healthcare environment. However, since we still need to maintain the office expense and make a living, we have some questions on the model:

1: When we treat patients with chemotherapy, we have high cost of office and staffs expenses, the administration fee on the procedures are needed to maintain the cost, how do you reimburse these kind of procedure since each chemotherapy procedures has different time, supplies and skill.etc. Procedure fee and drug margin will consist about 70% of profit margin, if these are going down so much, lots of small to medium  practices will close the door, patients will have more difficulty on choosing doctors and also big groups or big hospitals will control the price more.

2. CMS mentioned the private sectors can compete with each other even physicians or hospitals or GPO or special pharmaciesetc, if these healthcare sectors have been having conflicts of interest, how can that be able to lower the cost? Also, to create one more layer of middleman in the delivery of healthcare may actually increase cost?

3. If CMS implement this kind of medication method, will all insurance companies follow through? Otherwise, it will be more cost to the providers since they need to provide more staffs to accommodate different payment systems. The high cost of healthcare is not only because of medication but also the complication on the whole supplies chain on how healthcare provided to patients.  Government should maintain all centralize payment clearing house, EMR, authorization system, health data information exchange to reduce cost. Healthcare providers are spending so much money, time and energy to follow the guidelines, dig into different medical records, asking for referral and authorization and accommodate on different EMR system.etc.

4. Since FDA keep approving the drugs coming into market and also the NCCN or other guidelines has put these expensive drugs at early stage, we treat patients according to the guidelines, so it is not physician offices fault to use the high price medication.

Re: 	CMS-5528-ANPRM
	Comments on CMS Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking International Pricing Index Model for Medicare Part B Drugs 

Dear Administrator Verma:

Sioux Center Health appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (""Advanced Notice"") regarding the International Pricing Index (IPI) Model for Medicare Part B Drugs.  Sioux Center Health is a critical access hospital (CAH) that participates in the 340B program by virtue of providing safety net services to individuals located in rural and remote locations in the United States. CAHs face significant financial challenges and often struggle to keep their doors open. In fact, 90 rural hospitals have closed since 2010.  

We applaud the Administration's efforts to address the issue of high drug prices. CMS appears to be focused on using the IPI Model to test changes in payment for drugs that are currently paid by Medicare Part B based on average sales price (ASP). CMS intends for the IPI Model to incentivize providers to seek out lower costs for drugs and reduce inappropriate utilization by changing the add-on payment for drugs paid based on ASP. However, CMS has solicited feedback on whether to include CAHs in the IPI Model. Medicare recognizes that CAHs are unique and pays CAHs based on costs, not ASP. As providers that are not paid based on ASP, CMS does not need to include CAHs in the model to achieve its goals. For this reason and given the unique patient populations that we treat, and the challenges rural patients could face in accessing care if our hospital were included in the model, we ask that CMS exclude CAHs from the model. 



In addition, we are concerned that including our hospital in the IPI Model could limit our patients access to Part B drugs or disrupt their treatment. For example, model vendors could restrict how hospitals order drugs by requiring hospitals to submit patient and/or prescription information prior to shipping the drugs, limiting which hospital locations are able to receive drug shipments, or limiting the amount of inventory hospitals are able to access in advance of patient treatment. Such disruptions to the distribution system could also increase white/brown bagging practices, which could lead to drug safety and efficacy issues for patients. This impact would be especially problematic for our patients who may need to travel significant distances to receive care. For example, Avera Health is a rural healthcare system that spans over a four state area.  We try to help local patients receive services and infusions closer to home at their rural hospitals when working with specialty physicians within the Avera Health system to improve patient care and minimize patient travel time and costs.   


Participating in the IPI Model would also create operational burdens that could affect our ability to treat patients. Model participants would need to track model drugs given to Part B patients, which would require the creation of a manual process or investment in software to track model drugs. These operational burdens would be especially challenging for 340B hospitals, which already operate complex management systems to manage 340B and non-340B drug inventories. Imposing additional inventory tracking requirements on 340B hospitals would strain our scarce resources and further limit our ability to treat rural patients. 

We appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on this Advanced Notice. For the reasons outlined above, we respectfully urge CMS to exclude CAHs from the IPI Model.

Sincerely,

Sioux Center Health

Re: 	CMS-5528-ANPRM
	Comments on CMS Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking International Pricing Index Model for Medicare Part B Drugs 

Dear Administrator Verma:

Freeman Regional Health Services appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (""Advanced Notice"") regarding the International Pricing Index (IPI) Model for Medicare Part B Drugs.  Freeman Regional Health Services is a critical access hospital (CAH) that participates in the 340B program by virtue of providing safety net services to individuals located in rural and remote locations in the United States. CAHs face significant financial challenges and often struggle to keep their doors open. In fact, 90 rural hospitals have closed since 2010.  

We applaud the Administration's efforts to address the issue of high drug prices. CMS appears to be focused on using the IPI Model to test changes in payment for drugs that are currently paid by Medicare Part B based on average sales price (ASP). CMS intends for the IPI Model to incentivize providers to seek out lower costs for drugs and reduce inappropriate utilization by changing the add-on payment for drugs paid based on ASP. However, CMS has solicited feedback on whether to include CAHs in the IPI Model. Medicare recognizes that CAHs are unique and pays CAHs based on costs, not ASP. As providers that are not paid based on ASP, CMS does not need to include CAHs in the model to achieve its goals. For this reason and given the unique patient populations that we treat, and the challenges rural patients could face in accessing care if our hospital were included in the model, we ask that CMS exclude CAHs from the model. 



In addition, we are concerned that including our hospital in the IPI Model could limit our patients access to Part B drugs or disrupt their treatment. For example, model vendors could restrict how hospitals order drugs by requiring hospitals to submit patient and/or prescription information prior to shipping the drugs, limiting which hospital locations are able to receive drug shipments, or limiting the amount of inventory hospitals are able to access in advance of patient treatment. Such disruptions to the distribution system could also increase white/brown bagging practices, which could lead to drug safety and efficacy issues for patients. This impact would be especially problematic for our patients who may need to travel significant distances to receive care. For example, Avera Health is a rural healthcare system that spans over a four state area.  We try to help local patients receive services and infusions closer to home at their rural hospitals when working with specialty physicians within the Avera Health system to improve patient care and minimize patient travel time and costs.   

Participating in the IPI Model would also create operational burdens that could affect our ability to treat patients. Model participants would need to track model drugs given to Part B patients, which would require the creation of a manual process or investment in software to track model drugs. These operational burdens would be especially challenging for 340B hospitals, which already operate complex management systems to manage 340B and non-340B drug inventories. Imposing additional inventory tracking requirements on 340B hospitals would strain our scarce resources and further limit our ability to treat rural patients. 

We appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on this Advanced Notice. For the reasons outlined above, we respectfully urge CMS to exclude CAHs from the IPI Model.

Sincerely,

Freeman Regional Health Services

We believe, though, that CMMI demonstrations should be limited in scope as they test new payment and delivery concepts.  We further believe that there must be public transparency and collaboration with healthcare stakeholders as well as vigilant monitoring and quality evaluation to protect Medicare beneficiaries.

For rheumatology practices, there would be increased and perhaps unsustainable burden given, payer requirements for prior authorizations, drug administration, step edits, cost-sharing and detailed documentation. It would also affect patient access to new personalized options. Around the world America is regarded as the researchers/innovators with unparalleled access to care. We should be prideful of this and not limit access. Socialized medicine limits access to new drugs as evidenced by the Australian and European formularies. Trump plan is against american sentiment in that way.
A solution maybe to have improved transparency and put caps on PBM drug pricing. Or perhaps encourage American providers to pursue lower price drug algorithms prior to higher priced drugs.

151,CMS,False,0,,,"Dear Administrator Verma, 

I work for a Home Infusion Company and play a vital role in the coordination and care for our patients in need of life saving intravenous drugs in their home. Specifically Milrinone or inotrope therapy for end stage heart failure patients. This drug is used for getting the patient with heart failure stronger prior to heart transplant/lifesaving advanced surgical options, or palliative therapy. I've seen firsthand the difference or improvement this medication makes in patients who are suffering with this disease. 

I am writing today to ask you and CMS to REVERSE the policy known as the 21st Century Cures Act and further defined in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. In these Act's, Medicare would reimburse for an infusion drug administration calendar day for Milrinone only if a nurse or skilled professional is physically present in the patients home. This should not a realistic expectation to have daily nursing for this population of patients to get reimbursed. Nor would our patients want daily nursing visits, our patients have said to do so would make them feel like ""prisoners in their home because of their heart condition."" 

Instead Home Infusion Companies like mine are able to provide this complex therapy for our patients with weekly nursing visits safely in the home, a less costly location for treatment, while promoting independence and overall health due to less time spent in a hospital. Because so much goes into providing this therapy at home, from care coordination, clinical assessments, remote monitoring, pumps, supplies, mixing or compounding the medication, shipping and all other complexities that are involved with providing this beneficial treatment for Medicare beneficiaries in their home I'm asking CMS to change the current reimbursement for Milrinone in the home. 

CMS's final rule is wholly inadequate to cover home infusion  services and would cause home infusion suppliers to discontinue providing services to Medicare beneficiaries, forcing patients to receive their infusion in much costlier settings or not to be able to receive this life saving drug at all and end up dying. There are several publications noted that CMS budget estimates on which payment is based were erroneously calculated. Because of this it will be impossible for home infusion companies like mine to stay in business providing this life saving drug, Milrinone, for our patients. 

I am strongly urging CMS to do the following:

1) Remove the requirement that a skilled professional be physically present in the patients home in order to bill for home infusion therapy services 

2) Clarify that home infusion services be reimbursed on any day on which a patients receives professional services associated with parenteral administration of a part B covered drug and biologic administered through catheters and/or needles in the home

3) Broaden the definition of professional services to include initial and ongoing assessment, plan of care development, drug preparation, care coordination and other professional services. 

Finally in closing, I am asking on behalf of the patients I serve who are beneficiaries of Medicare and have a Part B covered diagnosis that CMS REVERSE this policy and issue additional rule making or guidance to interpret ""infusion drug administration calendar day"" to include the diverse array of services that are required to safety furnish infusion services in the patients home.

Re: 	CMS-5528-ANPRM
	Comments on CMS Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking International Pricing Index Model for Medicare Part B Drugs 

Dear Administrator Verma:

Avera St. Anthonys Hospital appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (""Advanced Notice"") regarding the International Pricing Index (IPI) Model for Medicare Part B Drugs.  Avera St. Anthonys Hospital is a critical access hospital (CAH) that participates in the 340B program by virtue of providing safety net services to individuals located in rural and remote locations in the United States. CAHs face significant financial challenges and often struggle to keep their doors open. In fact, 90 rural hospitals have closed since 2010.  

We applaud the Administration's efforts to address the issue of high drug prices. CMS appears to be focused on using the IPI Model to test changes in payment for drugs that are currently paid by Medicare Part B based on average sales price (ASP). CMS intends for the IPI Model to incentivize providers to seek out lower costs for drugs and reduce inappropriate utilization by changing the add-on payment for drugs paid based on ASP. However, CMS has solicited feedback on whether to include CAHs in the IPI Model. Medicare recognizes that CAHs are unique and pays CAHs based on costs, not ASP. As providers that are not paid based on ASP, CMS does not need to include CAHs in the model to achieve its goals. For this reason and given the unique patient populations that we treat, and the challenges rural patients could face in accessing care if our hospital were included in the model, we ask that CMS exclude CAHs from the model. 



In addition, we are concerned that including our hospital in the IPI Model could limit our patients access to Part B drugs or disrupt their treatment. For example, model vendors could restrict how hospitals order drugs by requiring hospitals to submit patient and/or prescription information prior to shipping the drugs, limiting which hospital locations are able to receive drug shipments, or limiting the amount of inventory hospitals are able to access in advance of patient treatment. Such disruptions to the distribution system could also increase white/brown bagging practices, which could lead to drug safety and efficacy issues for patients. This impact would be especially problematic for our patients who may need to travel significant distances to receive care. For example, Avera Health is a rural healthcare system that spans over a four state area.  We try to help local patients receive services and infusions closer to home at their rural hospitals when working with specialty physicians within the Avera Health system to improve patient care and minimize patient travel time and costs.   


Participating in the IPI Model would also create operational burdens that could affect our ability to treat patients. Model participants would need to track model drugs given to Part B patients, which would require the creation of a manual process or investment in software to track model drugs. These operational burdens would be especially challenging for 340B hospitals, which already operate complex management systems to manage 340B and non-340B drug inventories. Imposing additional inventory tracking requirements on 340B hospitals would strain our scarce resources and further limit our ability to treat rural patients. 

We appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on this Advanced Notice. For the reasons outlined above, we respectfully urge CMS to exclude CAHs from the IPI Model.

Sincerely,

Avera St. Anthonys Hospital
