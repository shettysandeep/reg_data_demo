13,CMS,False,1,,,"Spectrum Health Lakeland respectfully submits these comments in response to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Advanced Notice of Proposed Rule Making published in the Federal Register on October 30, 2018, regarding the International Pricing Index (IPI) Model for Medicare Part B drugs.  Spectrum Health Lakeland serves the Southwest Lower Michigan area as a Disproportionate Share Hospital under the 340B Program.  Spectrum Health Lakeland serves many low-income patients in the Southwest Lower Michigan area as evidenced by our CMS Disproportionate Share Percentage of 20.17%.  The 340B program is intended to provide resources to hospitals serving high volumes of low-income patients to enable those hospitals to provide more comprehensive services and treat more patients.

Spectrum Health Lakeland supports CMS for its efforts to reduce drug prices.  We are concerned, however, that the IPI Model would unintentionally eliminate the 340B program, which would negatively impact the ability of safety-net providers to treat low-income and vulnerable patients.  We also have several operational and patient care concerns relating to the IPI Model.  We ask that CMS consider measures to preserve the 340B program and address the patient care and operational issues in the attached file.

46,CMS,False,1,,,"APhA is pleased to submit comments to CMSs advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) to solicit public comments on potential options for testing changes to payment for certain separately payable Part B drugs and biologicals. APhA, founded in 1852 as the American Pharmaceutical Association, represents 62,000 pharmacists, pharmaceutical scientists, student pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and others interested in improving medication use and advancing patient care. APhA members provide care in all practice settings, including community pharmacies, hospitals, long-term care facilities, community health centers, physician offices, ambulatory clinics, managed care organizations, hospice settings, and the uniformed services. 

APhA strongly supports patient access to affordable and cost-effective medications and appreciates HHSs continued efforts to look at ways to improve efficiencies and reduce patients rising prescription drug costs by reforming current Medicare reimbursement models. As CMS notes in the ANPRM, many Part B medications are expensive, making it difficult for providers, including pharmacies, particularly those which are small, to float the inventory expense of these products for an extended period. In addition, it is administratively burdensome for pharmacists and pharmacies to obtain reimbursement for the Part B drugs they are able to provide, and reimbursements often fail to cover the actual cost of the product. As a result, patient access to many of these needed Part B medications is hindered because pharmacies cannot provide many of these products due to inadequate reimbursement and often undergo a complicated and time-consuming audit process requiring dozens of pages of documentation. APhA appreciates CMS testing any new model before implementing this policy more broadly but has some concerns with the proposed IPI model and offers the following comments. (See, attached .PDF for full comments). 

We appreciate CMSs continued work to spend health care dollars more cost-effectively for the benefit of the Medicare Program and its beneficiaries. As CMS moves forward, we hope you will use APhA as a resource. Thank you again for the opportunity to provide information on this important issue. If you have any questions or require additional information, please contact Michael Baxter, Director of Regulatory Affairs, at mbaxter@aphanet.org or by phone at (202) 429-7538.

84,CMS,False,0,,,"CMS is still moving in a wrong headed direction in pricing prescriptions in my opinion.  The vast majority of drugs covered under Medicare Part B could and should be covered under the Medicare prescription drug program, Medicare Part D.  The current procedure causes many problems for patients and providers, primarily pharmacies.  In some cases there is a disconnect so patients may not receive needed medications since it is not completely clear as to where the drug should be billed.  Pharmacies cannot continue to guess whether Part B or Part D is the appropriate billing mechanism.  In some cases a patient could be Part D eligible and also on dialysis, plus possibly in a rehab bed in a nursing home creating a billing dilemma.  Add hospice to the list and there can be other problems also.  

CMS has also created NADAC, National Average Drug Acquisition Cost, database.  This is a very good data base that pays pharmacies appropriately.  This should be used for virtually all drug pricing, including Part D prescriptions, hospice, dialysis, rehab patients, and any other Federal Government prescription drug pricing program.  With this pharmacies need to be compensated at a level that covers their cost to dispense based on state averages.  Each state Medicaid program had to conduct a survey recently or use an average of the surrounding states.  Also the National Community Pharmacist Association and National Association of Chain Drug Stores has conducted 2 surveys in the last 10 years and correlate very well with the state values.

258,CMS,False,0,,,"This proposed legislation would require pharmaceutical companies to sell their medicines in the United States for no more than the median price charged in five countries  Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan. If companies refuse to cut prices in the United States, the federal government could revoke existing patents or market exclusivities and allow generic drug manufacturers to sell knockoff copies of the medicines.

Such bills are deeply misguided. They'd stifle medical research, cutting Americans off from potentially life-saving new therapies.
Bringing a new drug to market is a monumental endeavor. It takes $2.6 billion and more than 10 years to do so, according to a study from the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development.

Researchers need to recoup this investment when the drug goes to market. If they can't price medications accordingly, then innovation isn't financially feasible. That would deprive patients of crucial new cures.

Plenty of research confirms this. One analysis of 25 major markets worldwide revealed that countries that had lower projected prices or smaller markets for new drugs launched fewer new drugs. It also took a longer time to launch those drugs. Another comprehensive study conducted at the University of Pennsylvania found that price controls would cause research and development intensity to decline between 36 and 48 percent.

Currently, the U.S. is a leader in medical innovation. We fund nearly half of the entire world's medical research and development, according to The Council of Economic Advisers. And from 2000 to 2010 (among the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and the U.K.) the U.S. companies produced 57 percent of new chemical entities, according to a report from the Milken Institute.

If the United States imposes drug price controls, medical innovation will grind to a halt, and ultimately hurt patients. This must not be allowed happen.

European-style socialist drug price controls on American companies, will bring medical development will come to a halt, cutting off our access to potentially life-saving medicines.

This is very important in order to keep patients compliant with our treatment pathways, which are designed to increase the value of care we deliver.  We would be forced to reduce our staff #s significantly if buy and bill revenue is limited to 6% of ASP, and even more so if ASP were reduced by 30%.

459,CMS,False,0,,,"Dear Sir/Madam,

I have been a private practice retina specialist for ten years and have witnessed in horror the high drug prices we pay in the United States versus the other countries. This includes everything from injectables to eye drops.  The high prices of the injectables in my clinic have prevented me from making it available to many patients due to the cost especially in light of uncertainty whether insurances will reimburse for these costly drugs.  Many patients, especially the poor can access these drugs more easily.  I can also afford to include these injectables for my free patients as many need them right now, if the prices are lowered. 

Yes the drug companies would argue that it will stifle innovation and lower the stock prices and what not, but why not have the Europeans, the Japanese and other wealthy nations share the cost, rather than charging Americans 5-30 times what it cost overseas.  The extent of the price differences are so dramatic, you don't see it in essentials like food, oil or car prices, and even the non-essentials.  My academic colleagues on the drug company dough will tell you that it will affect their ""research dollars"" but I believe our profession as physicians is to care for the well-being of the patients.  We also need to preserve the financial health of Medicare so it will be available for years to come.  I also believe the drug sales volume will increase partially offset the profit loss by the drug companies, in the process of helping more patients.  

If CME can require me, as a physician to charge Medicare patients less than my cash paying patients, I don't see why we can't do this for the drug companies.  Sure, I would like to charge 500 dollars a visit, and I believe I am worth it, but as a Medicare provider I have agreed to the CMS lower pricing. Physicians have endured cuts down to bare bones where many are leaving the profession and Medicare. I don't see anything wrong with doing that for a drug where the price of one injection surpasses my Medicare payment for all the other patients combined that day.  If that's the true price, then charge it equally across the globe.  If we are only the ones paying the inflated prices, this needs to stop.  Other large economies don't need us to subsidize.  We are already in debt up to our ears.  We need to do something both to preserve Medicare and help our patients.  Thank you for your consideration.
